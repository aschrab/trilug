TriLUG welcomes speakers on any topic related to free and open source software! If you have been invited to speak at TriLUG, or you would like to propose a talk yourself, read this page for information about what to expect.

If you are interested in speaking, please email steering@trilug.org with the topic you would like to speak on, the dates on which you are available, and a brief biography. You can also contact us if you have any questions about speaking which are not answered on this page.

<strong>Format:</strong> TriLUG talks are delivered in a lecture hall or similar space, to an audience of anywhere between 40 and 100. The "talk" section of each meeting lasts 70-90 minutes, including questions (however you wish to handle them).

<strong>Subject Matter:</strong> Anything related to Free and Open Source Software is fair game. This includes presentations about and demonstrations of particular software, but it also includes talks about the community aspects of FOSS, such as career development, community management, technical writing, presentation skills, and applications of FOSS in society.

We prefer talks that appeal to a broad range of FOSS users, including software developers, system administrators, community leaders, and hobbyists, using a variety of technology stacks, and at varying experience levels. As a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, we cannot engage in political campaigning, and prefer to avoid explicitly political topics.

<strong>Anti-Harassment:</strong> As stated in our <a href="http://trilug.org/anti-harassment">anti-harassment policy</a>, TriLUG is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion, country of origin, or age. We expect speakers to abide by this policy, and therefore to refrain from offensive verbal comments, deliberate intimidation, and sexualized images, activities, or other material.

(If you feel that you are particularly likely to be targeted for harassment, we can make special arrangements to ensure your safety.)

<strong>Date and Time:</strong> TriLUG meetings are held the second Thursday of each month. We are always looking for speakers.

<strong>Location:</strong> We are currently hosted in Raleigh, NC by Bandwidth. Bandwidth's offices are in Venture III, 900 Main Campus Dr, Raleigh, NC, 27606. We may shift locations occasionally as situations change, but all of our meetings have been in Raleigh for the past couple of years.

<strong>Audio, Video, Power:</strong> We will ensure that a projection screen with an HDMI, Mini-DisplayPort, and VGA laptop connector is available for presenters to use at each meeting, as well as at least one power outlet. If you need additional audio, video, or power capabilities, let us know in advance so that we can contact our hosts. If you plan to use a laptop to project slides or other material, we would appreciate if you allowed us to use it to project the meeting introduction slides.

<strong>Recording:</strong> Generally, TriLUG meetings are recorded and posted on YouTube. We can make exceptions if you would prefer not to be recorded.

<strong>Food and Beverage:</strong> Pizza and soft drinks are provided for attendees at each meeting. We do not currently make accomodations for vegans or gluten-free persons, but we may be able to do so upon request. Alcohol is not permitted at meetings.

<strong>Post-Meeting:</strong> After each meeting, we hold "TriCHUG" at a local restaurant (Ba-Da Wings in Raleigh) for food and/or beer. Usually about 10-12 members attend, but it is completely optional for speakers. (And despite the name, nobody gets hammered.)

<strong>Expenses:</strong> We currently do not have the funds to cover speakers' travel expenses or other expenses. (Someone may pay for your meal at the post-meeting, though.)
