Join us and Mike Seda at Red Hat HQ, May 13th, 7pm

Mike Seda, CEO and IT Consultant at Seda Systems, Inc., will introduce us to Puppet, an Open Source Data Center Automation and Configuration Management framework.
<!--break-->
Puppet, is an extremely powerful System Administration tool. This presentation will demonstrate the value in "Puppetizing" both system and application tasks that were originally performed only by hand or via home-grown scripts.

Mike Seda has years of System Administration experience in Research and Enterprise Computing environments. The niche skills that he accrued during this time were (and still are) deemed extremely rare and valuable in the IT industry. One such skill is Puppet, which he has been using to automate tasks for businesses of all sizes since 2008.
