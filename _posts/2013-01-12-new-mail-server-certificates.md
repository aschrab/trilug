It's that time of year again... time to renew our SSL certificates.

For the truly paranoid, here are the fingerprints of the new SSL certificates for mail.trilug.org.
<ul>
<li>SHA1 Fingerprint=2E:C7:8D:5A:BF:80:48:2B:FB:C8:78:EA:DA:E3:44:08:4E:45:DB:60</li>
<li>MD5 Fingerprint=9C:67:D3:55:53:06:F2:8C:0E:1E:30:A8:1A:50:38:5D</li>
</ul>
