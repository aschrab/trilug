Bio: Jon Magrini is a Red Hat TSE in the Storage SBR at Red Hat and joined their team a little over a year ago. His specialty is clustering, with a focus on storage related technologies. Jon's Linux experience started in the early 2000 era when he worked for Borland software and developed pluggable modules, using a pure java open-api for software products such as JBuilder and Together Control Center. His interest for storage started with employment at Red Hat and the purchase of his own EMC CLARiiON, which started a waterfall effect.
