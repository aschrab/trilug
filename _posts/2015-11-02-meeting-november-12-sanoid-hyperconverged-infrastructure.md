This meeting is sponsored by <a href="http://www.teksystems.com/">TEKsystems</a>, a leading provider of IT staffing, IT talent management and IT services.

<strong>Synopsis</strong>
Ever seen a machine reboot – desktop, to BIOS, to desktop again – in 1.5 seconds?  Ever seen multiple terabytes of data backed up offsite over a residental internet connection in under an hour?  Combine the ZFS filesystem and the Linux Kernel Virtual Machine, and you can do exactly that, and more.

Sanoid is a policy-driven snapshot management tool for ZFS filesystems, intended to leverage KVM and ZFS to make your systems functionally immortal.  We'll talk about what, how, and why.


<strong>Bio</strong>
Jim Salter (@jrssnet) is an author, public speaker, mercenary sysadmin, and father of three—not necessarily in that order. He got his first real taste of open source by running Apache on his very own dedicated FreeBSD 3.1 server back in 1999, and he's been a fierce advocate of FOSS ever since. He's the author of the Sanoid hyperconverged infrastructure project.  And previously, he's contributed to Ars Technica on everything from NAS distribution tools to next-gen filesystems.
