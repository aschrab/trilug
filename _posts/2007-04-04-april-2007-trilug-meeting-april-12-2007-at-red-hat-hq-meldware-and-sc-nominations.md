The April 2007 meeting of the Triangle Linux Users Group will be April 12, 2007 at Red Hat HQ (<a href="http://www.redhat.com/about/contact/ww/americas/raleigh.html">directions link</a>).  Our sponsor for the April meeting is <a href="http://www.altair.com/">Altair Engineering</a> (<a href="http://www.trilug.org/node/52">More info</a>).  

The speaker will be Andrew C. Oliver, CTO of BuniSoft.  Andrew will introduce Meldware Communication Suite, an open source, multi-platform groupware package for Linux. The  presentation will give an overview of Meldware, its Mail Server, Calendar Server, Webmail and Webcalendar as well as its Administration GUI. The talk will cover some of the technical details including Meldware's flexible email storage using any RDBMS or file system and the integration between the Calendar server and popular clients such as Mozilla Thunderbird, Novell Evolution and even Microsoft Outlook. The talk will wrap up with a demo, a brief description of the Buni.org communication software development community and a call to action for BETTER protocol standards in Email and Scheduling.

We will also be accepting nominations for election to the Steering Committee at this meeting. Nominations are open for all five steering committee positions and should be sent to the TriLUG discussion list or to nominate privately, via the <a href="http://www.trilug.org/contact">Contact TriLUG</a> page. Nominations must be received by May 4, 2007 at 23:59:59.  Please note that SC members are elected "at large" and then decide amongst themselves which position they will occupy.  Nominations need not be seconded.  You can nominate anyone, but they must accept your nomination to be eligible for election.  You can nominate yourself.
