The IPv4 address space is running out, and the future has arrived.
IPv6 is the new standard for the Internet, and the time to adopt it is
now.

Long time TriLUG member Kevin Otte is a Linux Systems Administrator
and a Network Engineer, and he has more IP addresses in his home
than some countries have.

Come hear Kevin give us not only the "what it is" and "the end is nigh"
parts of the IPv6 puzzle, but also the "how can I tinker with it" and "why
would I want to" parts, as well.
