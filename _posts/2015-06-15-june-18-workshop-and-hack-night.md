Work on a personal project, hone your skills, or try something you learned about at a recent meeting. While you're at it, help us maintain the TriLUG infrastructure.

Maybe you can bring an old phone down and see if <a href="http://www.cyanogenmod.org/">CyanogenMod</a> or another free OS can be flashed onto it, or play around with other free software available on your phone.

This month we continue tweaking our offsite backups, take the first steps down the path to the next incarnation of our infrastructure, and set up a group infrastructure git repository.  Come on down and dig in!
