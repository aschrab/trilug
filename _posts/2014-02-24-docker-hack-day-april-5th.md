<strong>What:</strong> Docker Hack Day
<strong>When:</strong> Saturday, April 5th at 9:15am - 4:00pm EDT. Meet in lobby at 9:00.
<strong>Where:</strong> Annex at Red Hat Tower, 190 E Davie St, Raleigh NC.
<strong>RSVP:</strong> Please email jackhill@jackhill.us to let him know you're coming (so you can get into the building), by 5:00pm on Thursday, April 3rd.

Thanks to Vincent Batts and his recent presentation, we have been exposed to the many possibilities of lightweight containers and easy management with docker. Instead of merely marveling at the possibilities, I would like to try to use docker to accomplish some real world tasks so I can better understand what types of problems I can use docker to solve. Let's meet Saturday, April 5th at 9:15am EDT at Red Hat's Raleigh offices. We can start by going through the quick start documentation and making sure everyone can run docker on their machines. Then we can hack on projects (e.g. a containerized email system) and share what we learn. If you have other ideas you would like to explore, please share them here. If possible, try <a href="http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/installation/">installing docker</a> before arriving as that will speed things along. This will be an hands on workshop, so please bring a computer.

<strong>Directions</strong>
Parking this weekend is $7 in all parking garages on Wilmington St, including the one in Red Hat Tower, due to special events. (Red Hat does not control the parking garage.) Street parking will be free and plentiful, especially at 9am, but leave a few extra minutes to find a space.

The Annex has a separate entrance, not in the main Red Hat lobby. From the main entrance to Red Hat Tower, proceed east on Davie St. (toward Blount), and look to your right as you approach Blount St. There will be an entrance marked "The Annex at Red Hat Tower" at 190 E Davie St.

If you park in the garage, there is an elevator in the North-East corner. Take it to ground level, and when you exit, the Annex will be immediately to your right.

<strong>Public Transit</strong>
The Moore Square bus station is 1 block away. It is the end point for most bus routes in Raleigh, and many TTA busses from all over the Triangle go there. More info is available from <a href="http://www.triangletransit.org/">Triangle Transit</a> directly. From the bus station, proceed south on Blount St, cross Davie St, and The Annex is just to the right on Davie St next to Calavera.

The Amtrak station is about 7 blocks away, although there are only a few trains per day.
