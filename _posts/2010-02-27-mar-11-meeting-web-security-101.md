HTML is "easy", right?  Security is not, right?  Come listen to Michael Peters discuss web security, why you should care, where you should care, and tips for the "rest of us" who don't (but should!) wear a paranoia hat daily.

Michael will explain the <!--break--> basics of web security, discuss various attack vectors (SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF, and more), and some avoidance tactics.  Whether you're an experienced web developer (we all need reminding) or just starting out, this talk can help avoid being the next easy harvest of The Bad Guys.
