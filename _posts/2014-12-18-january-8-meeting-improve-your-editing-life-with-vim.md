<strong>Synopsis:</strong>
I spend a large fraction of my time editing text, and am always on the lookout for things that will make the experience more enjoyable. In this talk, we will take a tour of the vim editor from how to use it and straight forward configuration options to arbitrary programming and scripting. While investigating these features, we will look at then through the lens of how they change your daily editing lives. There are, of course, other editors, and we will take a lightning tour of the other options.

<strong>Bio:</strong>
