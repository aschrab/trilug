The Triangle Linux Users Group will be holding it's annual December Social on December 13 from 7-10pm at the <a href="http://doubletree1.hilton.com/en_US/dt/hotel/RDUIIDT-Doubletree-Guest-Suites-Raleigh-Durham-North-Carolina/index.do">DoubleTree RTP</a> at 2515 Meridian Parkway, Durham, North Carolina.  This special meeting is sponsored by Google.

The December Social is a break from the regular TriLUG schedule of technical presentations and is purely a social and networking event meant to bring interested people from different areas of the Triangle tech & business scenes together.

This will also be the site and time for our annual food drive - see <a href="http://trilug.org/2007fooddrive">http://trilug.org/2007fooddrive</a> for more info.  

We are inviting several area user groups, computer science departments, and anyone with an interest in Linux, Open Source
Software and related subjects. If you are a developer, sysadmin, tech entrepreneur, tech blogger, journalist, open-source hacker, or like hanging out with these types of people, you are invited.  If you're not a techie, but interested in networking, you're still invited!  

Pizza and various beverages will be available.  ID required to partake of alcohol.  

You can bring a laptop for an impromptu LAN party.  You can play bzflag with the Triangle's best.  You can live-blog the event,  twitter, or whatever your heart desires.

Please add your name to the wiki page at <a href="http://www.trilug.org/wiki/TriLUG_December_Social_2007">http://www.trilug.org/wiki/TriLUG_December_Social_2007</a> if you plan to attend, as this will help us ensure that we have sufficient food, beverages, and Google schwag for everyone.

See you there!
