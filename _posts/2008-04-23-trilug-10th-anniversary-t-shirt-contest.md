To help celebrate the 10th anniversary of the Triangle Linux Users Group, we are holding a commemorative t-shirt contest.  To be included in the voting, shirt designs must include:

1) The phrase"Triangle Linux Users Group" or "TriLUG"
2) An indication of the 10th anniversary

To help everyone participate, we've created <a href="http://trilug.org/images/t-shirt_template.png">this template</a>.  Download at will.  Get your friends involved.  Don't worry about resolution for now.  If your design is selected, we'll work with you to beef up the production version.

The winner will have his/her design on the t-shirts and get a free one.  T-shirts will be available at a very reasonable price for everyone else.  Voting will take place at the July meeting so we can have the shirts ready for the August 10th anniversary meeting.  Participation is open to everyone, but to vote you'll need to be a TriLUG member, so pickup your membership form at the next meeting.
