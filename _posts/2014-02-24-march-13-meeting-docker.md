<strong>Abstract:</strong>
What is docker (<a href="https://www.docker.io">https://www.docker.io</a>), and how can it help me?

Linux containers are self-sufficient ways to deploy isolated applications for testing, developing, or running applications at scale. Come for a workshop on how to leverage this technology for more robust continuous integration, and developing/deploying across a diverse landscape of distributions.

We'll go over the fundamentals:
* Building a image for your application (if you're not a developer, that is ok :-)
* Wiring up that image for your use case
* Shipping that image (or even publishing it for others)

Feel free to bring your questions on docker-based solutions!
