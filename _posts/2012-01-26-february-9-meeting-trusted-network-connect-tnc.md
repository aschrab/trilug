The Trusted Computing Group is an international standards group developing standards for building blocks and software interfaces enabling secure computing environments.  Trusted Network Connect (TNC), a work group of TCG, provides a reference architecture and interfaces for network-based intelligent policy decisions, security automation, and communication between devices.  Many open source and Linux-based products implement TNC standards; we'll talk about the architecture and standards, current implementations, and real-world uses for TNC-enabled technology.

This overview is intended both as a standalone session and as background for a future session, in which we will take a deep dive into an open source, Linux-based security automation infrastructure leveraging the TNC IF-MAP interface.
