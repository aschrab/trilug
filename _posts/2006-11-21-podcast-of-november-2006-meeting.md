The first official TriLUG podcast of a meeting is available now.  The sound isn't as good as I'd like, but as production continues, we'll try to work out the kinks.  

Ogg file: <a href=http://trilug.org/podcasts/trilug-nov2006.ogg>trilug-nov2006.ogg</a>

This content will also be available in a patent-bound ball of litigation-ready fuzz (<a href=http://www.trilug.org/podcasts/trilug-nov2006.m4a>m4a</a>) on the iTunes Music Store later today.  

Comments and suggestions can be sent to <a href=mailto:mattfrye@gmail.com>Matt Frye</a>.
