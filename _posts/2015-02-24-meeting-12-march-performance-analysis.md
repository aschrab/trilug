<strong>Synopsis:</strong>
Jeremy will provide an overview of how the Performance Engineering group at Red Hat approaches performance analysis, show specific examples of testing methods that produced interesting results, and show how they are able to performance-tune infrastructure in the field using tools like tuned.

You will leave with a new appreciation for how many knobs and levers are available in the Linux kernel, and understanding how a practical approach to performance tuning can have a big impact on every-day deployments.

<strong>Bio:</strong>
Jeremy Eder is a Principal Software Engineer and Network Performance Lead at Red Hat Inc, where he specializes in measurement and analysis of kernel-related performance metrics, and using that analysis to guide performance-tuning of real-world infrastructure.
