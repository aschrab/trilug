The FOSS Fair is a barcamp or unconference style event and is completely driven by you, the participants.

So how can you help out with the FOSS Fair?

 * Give a Presentation or Session.  Sessions are 50 minutes and can be as formal or informal as you are comfortable with.  Everyone is   encouraged to hold a session.

 * Tell people about the FOSS Fair.  Know other groups on campus that would be interested?  Tell them.  Blog about FOSS Fair.  Be social about the FOSS Fair.

 * Do you have ideas about something that would make the FOSS Fair more of a success?  Door prises or other marketing opportunities?  Shoot Jack Neely an email and let him know.
