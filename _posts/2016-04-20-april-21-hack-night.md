Come hack on our new server, Moya - let's get it running to the point that Pilot can take a well-deserved rest.  Any and all help, big or small, appreciated!

...or bring a personal project down to work on.  Brainstorm with your fellow TriLUGers, bounce ideas around, hack!

If you can't make it in person, hop on IRC; we'll be hanging out on #trilug-sys on Freenode.
