Please join us December 14, 2006 at Red Hat for our annual Holiday Social/Potluck.  Take this time to catch up with TriLUG friends, play a few rounds of BZ Flag, and generally have a good time.  This event is a potluck, so bring desserts, hot food, wings, whatever to share with friends.

We'll also be collecting non-perishable foods to benefit the Raleigh Rescue Mission so bring some canned, dry, and other goods, but let's leave the Ramen at home this year. :-)

Questions/comments/high praise go to <a href="http://www.trilug.org/?q=node/43">the Contact TriLUG form</a>.
