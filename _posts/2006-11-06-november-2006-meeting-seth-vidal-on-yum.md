Seth Vidal ( <a href="http://blog.sethdot.org/">blog.sethdot.org</a> ), the maintainer of yum ( <a href="http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Tools/yum">fedora wiki entry</a> ), will give a talk.

Yum is a package management tool for rpm-based systems. It supports multiple architectures, multiple repositories and multiple
interfaces. Yum is widely used with Fedora Core, Centos, Yellowdog and other linux distributions. In the last year and a half Yum has gradually evolved a much more programmable library interface which has promoted a myriad of interfaces and tools, as well as a plugin
interface to allow users to easily add functionality to yum without modifying the source of the yum program, which has afforded more flexibility for systems administrators and end users in upgrading their systems.
