<strong>Abstract:</strong>
Are you responsible for a DNS domain, perhaps professionally, or a "vanity" domain for your personal email?  Have you given much thought to the DNS resolvers for that domain?  Every domain requires at least one DNS server, and everyone has probably heard that they should have a geographically disparate secondary server to hedge against catastrophic outages (network, building, etc).  Assuming you don’t have the luxury of a globally distributed set of datacenters, where should your secondary DNS server be hosted?  This talk will present one man's quest to answer that question, along with the data used to visualize and understand the available options.  There will also be a brief discussion of how that data was collected, and open source code (in Go, http://golang.org) to do it yourself.
