Ring in the end of the year with TriLUG! Our annual Holiday Party is a great time of delicious food, cool demos, and socializing with other FOSS enthusiasts. This year, we're at the Red Hat Annex in downtown Raleigh.

Demos of all kinds are welcome. It can be as simple as a cool piece of software you found on the Net, or as complicated as a 3-D printed electronic Halloween costume. Just let us know in the signup form. And food is provided! The party is being catered by Neomonde, and if you want to bring something else in addition, feel free!

We need to let Red Hat know our guest list by 5 PM on Wednesday, December 9. <a href="http://goo.gl/forms/OdfkC787Li">Use this form to RSVP.</a>
