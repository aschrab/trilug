Have you ever wished you could `apt-get install allmyapps`? After this presentation you can!

Deploying software to a production environment often presents challenges to those charged with infrastructure and operations. It is typical for each piece of software to come with a separate deployment and startup procedure, a unique layout of configuration files, and a different logging strategy.

Using the standard Debian package format is one way to unify software deployment. TriLUG member Igor Partola will be showing how to use Debian packages to create a powerful and flexible build and deploy process for your software.

The talk will include a tutorial portion showing how to prepare and package a piece of existing software, as well as a discussion of how to set up repositories for hosting your packages.

Igor Partola works as a developer and "man behind the curtain" at TransLoc Inc where, amongst other things, he has packaged most of the software stack as Debian packages. He has a wide array of interests in software engineering, including web applications and web application infrastructure and operations, mobile development and networking.
