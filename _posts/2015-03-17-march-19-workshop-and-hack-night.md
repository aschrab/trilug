Work on a personal project, hone your skills, or try something you learned about at a recent meeting (playing with "perf", anyone?). While you're at it, help us maintain the TriLUG infrastructure.

Our primary infrastructure objectives for this month's hack night will be setting up backups for pilot and discussing the next incarnation of TriLUG infrastructure; we would love to get your help and input on those!
