<strong>Synopsis:</strong>
In enterprise environments fault tolerance, redundancy, and high throughput are all major concerns. And there are few places where these concerns are as pressing as they are for enterprise storage. Multipath is a storage technology that fulfills all of these requirements and Device Mapper Multipath is a native multipathing solution for Linux systems. Though Device Mapper Multipath is mature, stable, and widely deployed it is often misunderstood and incorrectly deployed.

This presentation explains Device Mapper Multipath starting at theory of operation, to deployment, and finally through troubleshooting. The goal of the presentation is to provide a clear and complete description of how to deploy, understand, and resolve issues with Device Mapper Multipath on Linux systems. The material will be presented with a focus on Device Mapper Multipath on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 but is  also applicable to Fedora, CentOS, Scientific Linux, and other Fedora-derived distributions.
