The focus of this week's hack night we be to get a pilot (our current physical server) running as a VM on the new machine. Jmainguy has already copied over a disk image, so our tasks will be to verify that we are happy with the host configuration, to boot the pilot VM and verify that services (ssh, http, mail) are working properly, and to configure any proxying from the host to VM that is needed. If we are successful in this, we can draft a plan for swapping out the current pilot for the new VM server.

Come join us for some intellectual socializing and hacking for a great cause!
