<strong>Synopsis:</strong>
The domain of financial record keeping could greatly benefit from new open source projects that provide accounting software solutions for the small to medium enterprise. The current offerings don't fulfill contemporary requirements, are often buggy and moribund in the maintenance of the code base, or are intractable to implement without extensive commitment from third party developers.

Quickbooks Online and Xero accounting will be held up as representative targets from the commercial world that the open source community should pursue with competitive products and frameworks. The talk will delve into GnuCash and other open source offerings, showing their strengths and weaknesses in today's world.

<strong>Bio:</strong>
Eric is not an accountant, he is a bookkeeper. He has been using Quickbooks for over 17 years in a wide range of industries, but he is drawn to Python and Open Source for some strange reason. I think he would prefer to give it all up and go back to theater set design, but such is life.
