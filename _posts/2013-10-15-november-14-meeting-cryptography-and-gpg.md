<strong>Abstract:</strong>

Cryptography has been in the news a lot lately. We'll start with a quick overview of some of the major recent headlines, specifically about the NSA's attempts to circumvent and break encryption and what experts are recommending to stay as secure as possible online. This will be followed with a high-level overview of cryptography. We'll look at where it's been made easy to use, and were it's not so easy. Then we will dig into the details of using GPG from the command line, to encrypt documents and to verify software packages.
