This TriLUG meeting is a "Triple Play", with three related topics presented together.
<ul>
<li>Brian McCullough will present CAcert</li>
<li>Jack Hill will present GPG</li>
<li>Evan Daniel will present Freenet</li>
</ul>

<strong>CAcert</strong>
The first topic is an introduction to CAcert.org (<a href="cacert.org">www.cacert.org</a>).  CAcert is a community driven certificate authority (CA) that issues digital certificates to members free of charge.  CAcert uses the Web of Trust (WoT) model to validate identities to provide more functionality to members.  This presentation will introduce CAcert, it's mission, and it's services.

<strong>Freenet</strong>
Freenet (<a href="https://freenetproject.org/">freenetproject.org</a>) is a distributed peer-to-peer data storage network. It enables users to store and retrieve documents, and provides strong anonymity and censorship resistance. Applications exist to use the network for file sharing, publishing and viewing web pages, social networking, and mail. The talk will cover the philosophy behind Freenet; an overview of data storage, routing, and cryptography; a programmer's perspective on using the network; and installation and setup of the software.

<strong>GPG</strong>
An introduction to openPGP (rfc 4880) formatted keys and messages. After the talk, the audience should have the necessary understanding to participate in the global web of trust. To this end we will cover how to manipulate keys using the GnuPG command line interface, how to interpret portions of the web of trust to make real world decisions, and an overview of what to expect in a keysigning. I will also give motivating examples of why participating in the global web of trust is useful: authenticating email, and
distributing software free from tampering.

Jack Hill is UNC-CH student and web developer with interests in scientific and educational software and functional programming.
