Please join us February 8, 2007 at 7pm at Red Hat HQ (<a href="http://www.redhat.com/about/contact/ww/americas/raleigh.html">map and directions</a>) for another great TriLUG meeting!

Greg Dekoenigberg, Red Hat's Community Development Manager, will be speaking on the <a href="http://www.laptop.org">One Laptop Per Child</a> (OLPC) project.  OLPC is a laptop and accompanying software created expressly for the world's poorest children living in its most remote environments.
