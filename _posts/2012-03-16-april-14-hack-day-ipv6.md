This TriLUG Hack Day is about everything IPv6.  Bring your PCs, smartphones, tablets, routers, or other interesting devices to see how they'll work in our IPv6 test lab.  Come and get some hands-on experience with IPv6 on your own equipment. 

This day is about preparing for <a href="http://www.worldipv6launch.org/">World IPv6 Launch Day</a> on 6th June.  On this day, ISPs and Website operators will switch on IPv6 - permanently !
