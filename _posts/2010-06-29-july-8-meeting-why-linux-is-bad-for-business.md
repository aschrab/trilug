We all love free software.  We think it should be used everywhere,
right?  And that means Linux... Linux everywhere, right?

Not always.  Actually, there are times when Linux is not such a
great fit for the task.  There are other solutions...

Wesley Shields will be telling us about his favorite open source
project, and how it can be a good fit for companies that need a Unix
solution.  He'll tell us what's similar to Linux, what's different, and
why companies might care.
