Jeremy Agee works in Red Hat's Identity Management group, where he helps enterprise customers set up systems to manage users and resources.  He knows from personal experience that getting started with user management systems can be tough, but it does not have to be.

Most of us have probably seen pieces of the puzzle.  Jeremy will fill in those gaps, introducing us to the basic structure and concepts of managing users.  He will walk through an installation of OpenLDAP so we can set up an LDAP server ourselves.  Finally, he will touch on some advanced topics, so that we'll know what pieces might be left to build on.

Join us for this in-depth "how-to" talk.  It promises to be educational and fun.

NOTE - Elections for the 2011/2012 Steering Committee will be held before the presentation.  You must be a TriLUG member (either already, or having filled out a membership form at the April meeting) to vote.
