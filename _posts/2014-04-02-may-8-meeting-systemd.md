<strong>Abstract:</strong>
This presentation will briefly review the Linux boot process and the old SystemV startup process. It will then discuss in more detail the startup process using systemd, and the reasons for creating the new systemd daemon and some of the advantages it provides. We will also discuss configuration files and some of the more common commands required to cause systemd to do our bidding.  Backward compatibility will also be covered.
