- with Greg DeKoenigsberg, Red Hat HQ, April 8th 7pm
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Join us in April when Greg DeKoenigsberg, Senior Community Architect for Red Hat, presents a retrospective on the use of open source in education, with lessons learned from the OLPC project, along with future ideas of collaboration in teaching.

Greg is certainly in a position to know what he's talking about - he was a community advisor to the One Laptop Per Child project and a founding board member of the Sugar Labs project. He serves on the advisory boards of several open source advocacy organizations, writes about open source issues, and speaks at open source events worldwide.
