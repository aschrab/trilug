Following the TriLUG tradition, the December meeting will be a social event, with no formal program.  Members and friends are invited to gather, eat, and blow each other to bits (in bzflag or any other game of your choice).

Dinner will be potluck.  Bring a dish to share.  Sign up <a href="http://www.trilug.org/wiki/TriLUG_20081211_PotLuck">on the wiki</a>.
