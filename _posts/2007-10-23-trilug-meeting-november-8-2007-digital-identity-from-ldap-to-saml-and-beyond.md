The November 2007 meeting of the Triangle Linux Users Group, sponsored by <a href="http://sun.com">Sun Microsystems</a>, will be held Thursday, November 8, 2007 at Red Hat. Directions can be found <a href="http://www.redhat.com/about/contact/ww/americas/raleigh.html">here</a>.  Pat Patterson from Sun Microsystems will provide us with a developer perspective on digital identity, starting from the emergence of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LDAP">LDAP</a> in the 90s, through <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Sign_On">single sign-on</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SAML">SAML</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Alliance">Liberty Alliance</a> protocols to recent developments such as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID">OpenID</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardspace">Cardspace</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth">OAuth</a>. The emphasis will be on understanding the protocols and how they are implemented in the real world, with a particular focus on deciding which (if any!) approach to select for a given project. 

Pat Patterson is a federation architect at Sun Microsystems, focusing on federation, identity-enabled Web services and <a href="http://opensso.dev.java.net">OpenSSO</a>, Sun's open-source implementation of those technologies. Pat's <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/superpat">blog</a> centers on identity-related topics.
