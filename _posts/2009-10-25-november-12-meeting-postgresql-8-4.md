Location: Red Hat HQ, NCSU Centennial Campus
Speaker: Andrew Dunstan
Time: 7pm

The <a href='http://www.postgresql.org/' title='The Postgres homepage'>PostgreSQL</a> project released v8.4 of its relational database in July.  Andrew Dunstan will introduce us to the project as a whole, and delve into some of the <a href='http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/release-8-4.html' title='Postgres v8.4 release features'>new features</a> (e.g. Windowing Functions) of the recent release.  Andrew is also part of the Postgres development team, so as a bonus, we may get a sneak peek at in-development improvements (e.g. Streaming Replication).

Postgres is behind the scenes of <a href='http://www.postgresql.org/about/users' title='Postgres Featured Users'>many well-known sites and companies</a>, including Cisco, Debian, MySpace, OpenStreetMap, Skype, and Yahoo!.<!--break-->
