Keith will talk about intellectual property as a reality that shapes the context for open source software, particularly when overlaid against trends in technologies such as mobile and cloud computing, provide the history of <a href="http://www.openinventionnetwork.com/">Open Invention Network</a> and its licensee community, and discuss Linux Defenders and other opportunities for community members to contribute proactively for the benefit of open source software.


Keith Bergelt is the chief executive officer of <a href="http://www.openinventionnetwork.com/">Open Invention NetworkÂ®</a> (OIN), the collaborative enterprise that enables innovation in open source and an increasingly vibrant ecosystem around Linux. In this capacity he is directly responsible for enabling, influencing and defending the integrity of the Linux ecosystem. Central to the achievement of his goals is the acquisition and transfer of patent rights designed to permit members of the Linux ecosystem to operate free of the threat of assertion and litigation from those whose business models are antithetical to innovation and global economic growth in information technology and computing.
