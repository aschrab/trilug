<I>NOTE - There was some concern that our speaker might not be able to make it on Thursday night, but we have confirmed that the presentation will proceed as originally planned. - Alan Porter, 9/8 10pm</I>

In 2002, Tarus Balog took a leap of faith by leaving his steady day job and taking over the management of a software package called OpenNMS.  He has managed to slowly grow his business by providing support for this open source package, and by following the mantra "spend less than you earn".

Tarus will share his experiences with open source business, how it is viewed by customers, competitors, contributors and leeches.

And if you've got this lingering feeling that you could participate in the open source world and make it your full-time profession, Tarus has plenty of advice.  Come join us for an unforgettable talk.
