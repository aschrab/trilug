Synposis: True high availability load balancing traditionally involves specialized, expensive hardware and software. However, you can build advanced, high availability configurations without a single point of failure using nothing but open source tools and commodity hardware. This talk will include a discussion of several tools, configurations, and advantages and disadvantages thereof. All tools involved are 100% free and open source. As a bonus topic, Simon will tell you how to use open source load balancing tools to IPv6-enable your IPv4-only infrastructure with minimal risk, time and hassle.
