Daniel Chen is a Master of the Universe.  No, not like "He-Man".  He contributes significant time to the Ubuntu project, helping make audio applications and infrastructure "just work".  This is a huge undertaking, since there are so many sound card drivers and so many audio frameworks that have come and gone over the years.  This work has earned him the title of MotU from the Ubuntu team.

Dan will give us an idea of how audio works in Linux (visualize: spaghetti).  And he'll share tips and tricks on making audio applications work seamlessly... or, at least with less frustration than before.

Dan is part of the TriLUG diaspora, who frequently graced our presence in years past, but who now only return when bribed with free pizza and the chance to speak in front of the crowd.  Let's give Dan a big homecoming welcome.
