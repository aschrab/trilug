We'll be putting the July meeting in the hands of the TriLUG community by holding a series of Lightning Talks. Lightning talks are short talks of about 5-15 minutes long that give the audience a taste of a topic rather than going into the great detail associated with formal presentations. If you've been working on a cool project lately or learned something cool about technology, you are qualified to present something!

If you have an idea for a talk, please pitch it on the TriLUG mailing list and the community will help you cultivate it into a presentation you can be proud of. Prepend your subject line with "LT:" to make it easy to find (ie subject = "LT: Using Inkscape").  The Steering Committee will then collate a list of the topics and speakers from the mailing list posts. There isn't a set theme yet, but we expect a theme will emerge from the discussions in the next couple of weeks.
