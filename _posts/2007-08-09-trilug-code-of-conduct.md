THIS IS A DRAFT DOCUMENT. IT IS NOT YET OFFICIAL.

2nd Draft.

Members of the TriLUG community need to work together effectively, and this code of conduct lays down the "ground rules" for our cooperation.

<strong>Be considerate.</strong> - Not all members of the TriLUG community are as knowledgeable as you may be.  When answering questions, be polite, helpful and honest.

<strong>Be respectful.</strong> - Everyone can make a valuable contribution to TriLUG. We may not always agree, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. We expect members of the TriLUG community to be respectful when dealing with others as well as with people outside TriLUG when representing the TriLUG.  

<strong>Be collaborative.</strong> - Linux, Open Source, and Free Software are about collaboration and working together. Collaboration reduces redundancy of work done and improves the quality of our results. You should aim to collaborate with other members of the TriLUG community, as well as members of other organizations within the user group community. Your work should be done transparently and ideas from TriLUG projects should be given back to the community when they are made, not just when your project is completed.   If you wish to work on new initiatives or projects for TriLUG, don't feel obliged to have TriLUG-wide agreement before you begin.  Simply  keep the TriLUG community informed of your work, and publish your work in a way that allows outsiders to test, discuss and contribute to your efforts.

<strong>When you disagree, consult others.</strong> - Disagreements, both political and technical, happen all the time and the TriLUG community is no exception. The important goal is not to avoid disagreements or differing views but to resolve them constructively. You should turn to the community and to the community process to seek advice and to resolve disagreements. We have the Steering Committee, which will help to decide the right course for TriLUG, but there are many leaders in many different disciplines within TriLUG who may be able to help you figure out which direction will be most acceptable. If you really want to go a different way, then we encourage you to expand and enrich the user group community by starting a new  user group focused on your special interest.  TriLUG isn't worried about competing with other groups, but wishes to assist and facilitate wherever possible and appropriate.  

<strong>When you are unsure, ask for help.</strong> - Nobody knows everything, and nobody is expected to be perfect in the TriLUG community.  Asking questions avoids many problems down the road, and so questions are encouraged. Those who are asked should be responsive and helpful. However, when asking a question, care must be taken to do so in an appropriate forum. Off-topic and "meta" questions should be marked as such (Subject: OT and/or META...).  

<strong>Step down considerately.</strong> People come and go from any collaborative group. When you leave or disengage from TriLUG, in whole or in part, we ask that you do so in a way that minimizes disruption to the LUG. This means you should tell people you are leaving and take the proper steps to ensure that others can pick up where you leave off. This is mainly important for those providing volunteer services that others have come to depend on.

<strong>Mailing lists and IRC</strong>

Mailing lists and IRC are important parts of the TriLUG community platform. This code of conduct applies very much to your behavior in those forums too. Please follow these guidelines.  

   1. Please use a valid email address to which direct responses can be made.
   2. Please avoid flamewars, trolling, personal attacks, and repetitive arguments.  

<strong>Team leaders</strong>

In addition to this Code of Conduct, we hold our community leaders (such as IRC operators, mailing list owners, and the Steering Committee) to an even higher standard which is documented in the Leadership Code of Conduct.
