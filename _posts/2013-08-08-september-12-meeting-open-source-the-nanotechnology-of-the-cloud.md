Michael Tiemann started the world's first open source software company, thereby placing the topic of open source into the field of economics.

Ignored for several years, open source has helped to rewrite the rules of economics, and has become an important subject among Nobel laureates.  After reviewing 20+ years of Nobel Prize lectures in economics, Tiemann has synthesized a new perspective on the economics of cloud computing and the continued role that open source will play in the development of this new paradigm.
