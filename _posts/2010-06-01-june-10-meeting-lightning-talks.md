This month, YOU are the speaker!

Got something interesting that you'd like to share?  can't wait for BarCamp?  We're hosting our own mini "unconference" style meeting, where members of the audience will be given 5-10 minutes to present an idea or open source tool.

To get an idea of what folks have in mind, see the wiki page here -> <a href="http://trilug.org/wiki/Meeting:2010_June_10">Meeting:2010_June_10</a>

Vote for your favorite presentation... the winner gets a prize (TBA).
