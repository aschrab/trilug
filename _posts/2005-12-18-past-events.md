<strong>Fifth Anniversary Celebration, Thursday, November 13, 2003</strong>

TriLUG's very first meeting was November of 1998 which means that TriLUG is 5 years old.  At our 5th anniversary meeting on 13/Nov/2003, 5 people out of 76 had been to the original meeting in Manning Hall on the campus of UNC. Congratulations, TriLUG, on 5 good years.  Here's hoping the next 5 are just as good as the last ones.

Bring your computer and peripherals (monitor, keyboard, mouse, power cables, power strips). Although we may have some extra peripherals, they will be limited.  Also, bring blank CDs if you'd like copies of the latest distributions, and a floppy disk or two doesn't hurt if you can't boot your computer from CD.

<strong>Eric S. Raymond Talk, Mon., Feb. 10, 2003</strong>

What:  Special Talk
Who:  <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/">Eric S. Raymond</a>
Where: NC School of Science and Math Auditorium, Durham (<A HREF="ncssm_directions.php">directions</A>)
Date:  Monday, February 10, 2003
Time:  7:00pm
Sponsors: Ibiblio.org and TriLUG

TriLUG is please to announce that Eric S. Raymond will be speaking to us at this special event.  Please mark your calendars and plan to attend.
Mr. Raymond will be speaking on "Freedom, Power, and Software: What the Internet teaches us about ethics and politics."

Eric S. Raymond is an observer-participant anthropologist in the Internet hacker culture. His research has helped explain the decentralized open-source model of software development that has proven so effective in the evolution of the Internet. His own software projects include one of the Internet's most widely-used email transport programs [fetchmail]. Mr. Raymond is also a science fiction fan, a musician, an activist for the First and Second Amendments, and a martial artist with a Black Belt in Tae Kwon Do.  His home page is at <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr">http://www.catb.org/~esr</a>

Eric Raymond is on the Board of the Open Source Initiative and VA Software. He is editor of "The New Hacker's Dictionary" and author of "The Cathedral and the Bazaar." Eric has been a sparing partner of Richard Stallman in the debate between "Free Software" and "Open Source" software.

Eric Raymond was also the manager of the sunsite (now ibiblio) Linux Archive for several years.

Please <a href="/ncssm_directions.php">see here</a> for directions to the talk. This is the same location where TriLUG met for Robin Miller's talk in February 2002 and Eben Moglen's in December 2001.

<strong>RPM class, Sat., Jan. 11, 2003</strong>

Instructor: Tanner Lovelace
Location: Dreyfus Auditorium
Date:  Saturday, January 11, 2003
Time:  Class starts at 2 pm.
Audience: Some Linux experience recommended.
RSVP to: LisaB at trilug.org

Tanner will be covering the RPM package manager program, as well as how to create your own RPMs. 

<strong>Mail Server Class, Sat. Nov. 9, 2002</strong>

Teacher:  Jon Carnes
Place:  RTI (same place as monthly meetings) (<A HREF="dreyfus_directions.php">directions</A>)
Date:  Saturday, November 9, 2002
Time:  Class starts at 2 pm.
Audience: Newbie (veterans feel free to come and help others!)
RSVP to: LisaB at trilug dot org

Jon will be detailing how to set up your own mail server starting from the beginning ("newbie") point-of-view. He will be talking in general terms but will also demonstrate the steps on his machine using Red Hat. You may bring your own machine to work on during the class or come just to listen and take notes. There will be a time of discussion for getting specific help with your computer if necessary.

If you bring your own machine, you will need to bring everything (monitor, keyboard, mouse, power cables, etc) for it. I recommend that you arrive around 1:30 so you can have your machine in place and ready to go by the time the class starts at 2 pm. You will need a working installation of Linux before you come to class. Jon will be going over installation and configuration of the additional programs needed to run your own mail server.

If you are bringing a computer with something other than Red Hat or Mandrake on it, please let me know so I can make sure we have some experts there to cover that distro.

Jon's lecture notes from this class are archived here: <a href="http://www.trilug.org/~jonc/mailserver/Intro.html">http://www.trilug.org/~jonc/mailserver/Intro.html</a>
