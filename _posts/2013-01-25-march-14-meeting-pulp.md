<a href="http://www.pulpproject.org/">Pulp</a> creates and manages repositories of content, such as software
packages, and can push that content out to large numbers of machines.
Today Pulp manages RPM content (including srpm, drpm, etc.) and Puppet
modules, and many other types are on the road map. There is a
community project well under-way to implement Debian support.
 
If you want to locally mirror all or part of a repository, host your
own content in a new repository, manage content from multiple sources
in one place, and push content you choose out to large numbers of
clients, Pulp is for you!
