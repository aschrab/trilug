High Altitude Balloon Flights to Near Space
Presented by Jonathan R. Trappe & Tanner Lovelace

Recently, several LUG members competed in a challenge
to gather pictures of the curved horizon of the Earth from
near-space... not with rockets and elaborate gear, but on
the cheap, using a balloon and consumer-grade equipment.

Jonathan Trappe and long-time LUG member Tanner Lovelace
will talk about the challenge rules, and how the team assembled
and weighed ideas quickly, launching their balloon after just
three weeks of planning.  Then we'll hear how things did not
quite go as planned, but how these quick-thinking geeks
recovered to achieve their goal.

After the launch and recovery of their high-altitude balloon,
this team was featured on WRAL, NPR news, and on the
front page of the News & Observer!  But NOW, they're hitting
the big time -- speaking at a TriLUG meeting!
