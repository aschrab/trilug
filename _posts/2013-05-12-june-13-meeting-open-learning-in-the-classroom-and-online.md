We are extremely fortunate to have Cathy Davidson speaking June 13th at TriLUG!  Make sure you do not miss this rare opportunity! Cathy Davidson is an extraordinary individual and a brilliant minded speaker, who is a highly influential player in the world of open education in the universities. 
She is the first educator to serve on the six-person Board of Directors of the Mozilla Foundation!  She'll include in her talk, discussion of her two current peer-taught, peer-evaluated classes and her upcoming work to prepare for a Coursera MOOC entitled "The History and Future of Higher Education". Make sure your schedule allows for you to attend this special event. Also, spread the word to your fellow digerati and invite them to attend. 

<strong>Please note that this meeting will be held at a new venue</strong>, so there will be some shifts in the usual schedule. NCSU does not permit food in its classrooms, so we are going to begin the meeting with a reception/networking over our usual pizza in the atrium of Engineering Building 2. At about 7:30 we'll move to 1021 to begin businesss, community announcements, and the presentation.
