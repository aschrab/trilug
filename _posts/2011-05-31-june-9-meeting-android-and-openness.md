When: Thursday, June 9th, 7pm
Where: Red Hat HQ, NCSU Centennial Campus
Map: http://www.redhat.com/about/contact/ww/americas/raleigh.html

Android has taken the mobile market by storm, in part due to its open source nature (did you know it is based on the Linux kernel?). However, Android development has had to walk a delicate line between developers demanding openness and the established mobile industry that prefers to lock everything down.

In this talk, Luke will introduce Android as a mobile development platform, discussing the architecture and development tools available, as well as the history of how Android has walked the line between open and closed.

Luke Meyer, web geek and open source zealot, started TriDroid, the Triangle Android Meetup, because no one else had done so yet when he wanted to start hacking for his G1 phone. He currently works technical support for SpringSource at VMware. Previously he worked as a web engineer at Red Hat.
