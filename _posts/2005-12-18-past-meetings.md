The September meeting of the Triangle Linux Users Group (TriLUG) will be Thursday, September 11, 2003 at 7:00pm in Dreyfus Auditorium at RTI (<A HREF="dreyfus_directions.php">directions</A>). Our topic for the September meeting will be Multi-platform GUI programming presented by John Franklin. 

Web designers can transform the blank page into a graphical application with a distinctive touch.  Their users are treated to interfaces that can channel their attention through any process, or give them a map that makes finding the data they want an effortless experience.  Executives enjoy seeing their hard-built brand image appear on a digital medium.  With the judicious use of CSS, a graphic designer can change the entire presentation without touching a single line of back-end PHP.

We want to have the ability to easily build interfaces for cross-platform applications that are distinctive like web pages.  We're 
talking real, native applications.  No web browser, no VM, no free viewer.  Code on the chip.  We want to make the interface identical pixel-for-pixel regardless of platform.  We want the art department to stop bothering the developers for every little change.

On Thursday, September 11th find out how we did it.

As always, meetings are free, as is the pizza!

<strong>Thurs. Aug 14, 2003</strong>

Our topic for the August meeting will be "Linux and Public Policy," presented by Michael Tiemann, Chief Technical Officer for Red Hat, Inc.

Michael Tiemann is a true open source software pioneer. He made his first major open source contribution over a decade ago by writing the GNU C++ compiler, the first native-code C++ compiler and debugger. His early work led to the creation of leading open source technologies and the first open source business model.

In 1989, Tiemann's technical expertise and entrepreneurial spirit led him to co-found Cygnus Solutions, the first company to provide commercial support for open source software. During his ten years at Cygnus, Tiemann contributed in a number of roles from President to hacker, helping lead the company from fledgling start-up to an admired open source leader.

While all good Penguinistas believe that World Domination will be achieved Now (or Real Soon Now), faith needs to be supported by facts.  What are the economic and political forces that are pushing Open Source forward?

Will the new wide world of Open Source be good for the US software industry. . . or suck most of the jobs overseas?

Can established interests thwart our dreams?

Those who want to peek can look at some of the evidence at Rosenberg's Corner at <a href="http://www.consultingtimes.com/">www.consultingtimes.com.</a>

Don Rosenberg is the author of <a href="http://www.stromian.com/BookPage.html">Open Source:  The Unauthorized White Papers</a>, and spoke to TriLUG on Open Source licensing last year.

<strong>June 13, 2002</strong>

The Thursday, June 13 meeting of the Triangle Linux Users Group (TriLUG) had to be switched at the very last minute from the XML Catalogs 
presentation to one on Current, a drop-in replacement server for Red Hats' up2date utility.  Thanks very much to Hunter Matthews
for giving the presentation on <b>extremely short</b> (as in 15 minutes) notice.  Regrets also go out to Mark Johnson, who thanks to his
airline, got stuck in Minneapolis.  Hopefully Mark will be able to give his talk sometime in the future.

More information about Current can be found here: <a href="http://www.biology.duke.edu/computer/unix/current/">http://www.biology.duke.edu/computer/unix/current/</a>.

Our talk this month will start at 7:30:

Improving Developer Productivity on Linux with Visual SlickEdit

The mountain of technologies, languages, APIs, and lines of code developers need to work with keeps growing exponentially. Scaling the software development mountain requires an editing environment that can manage, analyze, navigate, and edit code written in multiple languages. Using example applications built on open source projects, this presentation will address how developers can improve productivity on Linux with Visual SlickEdit.

SlickEdit Inc. (formerly MicroEdge) has been providing development tools for Linux since August 1996.

Representing SlickEdit will be Speaker: Ed Hintz, Director of Software Development

Ed Hintz has over 13 years of experience in the software industry. He has led development efforts on several e-commerce applications as well as development tools that were recognized with two Windows Magazine Win 100 awards. Prior to joining SlickEdit, Mr. Hintz was Vice President of Engineering at GadgetSpace (now InPhonic), founding software architect at HAHT Commerce, and held positions at Q+E Software, NCR, and IBM. Mr. Hintz holds a BS in computer science from Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.

As always, meetings are free, as is the pizza!

So, come join us for pizza, elections, and Visual SlickEdit!
