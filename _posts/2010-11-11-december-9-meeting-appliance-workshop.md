NOTE - THE DECEMBER MEETING WILL NOT BE AT RED HAT.
IT WILL BE AT SPLAT SPACE IN DURHAM.  STARTS AT 7PM.

Every year, we try to do something a little different for our December "holiday" meeting.  This year is no exception.

We will be meeting at Splat Space, the newly-formed "hackerspace" in Durham.  This meeting will be an interactive hands-on workshop, with a handful of demo stations that each showcase one Linux-based "appliance".  For example, we'll show:

 - BackupPC - Take an old PC and put a large hard disk on it, and let it handle your backups.
 - MythTV - Watch and record TV using a Linux PC.
 - Asterisk - Have your own PBX, with voice mail and call routing.

If you are interested in a particular topic, or if you would like to volunteer to run one of the demo stations, sign up on the wiki --> http://trilug.org/wiki/Meeting:2010_December_9
