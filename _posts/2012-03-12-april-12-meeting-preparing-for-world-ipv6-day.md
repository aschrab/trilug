<strong>Kevin Otte:</strong> <a href="http://www.trilug.org/~kjotte/w6l-trilug.pdf">(Slides)</a>
Major ISPs, home networking equipment manufacturers, and web companies around the world are coming together to permanently enable IPv6 for their products and services by 6 June 2012.

<strong>Igor Partola:</strong> <a href="http://igorpartola.com/trilug/ipv6/">(Slides)</a>
Using IPv6's global addressing as a way to get direct connectivity between my home and office. With IPv4 we had to setup up a VPN which required some management. Having IPv6 at home and work (via TunnelBroker) makes it easy to connect directly to the machines I want to get to. Teredo/miredo helps connecting from coffee shops, etc. when on the go.

<strong>Alan Porter:</strong> <a href="http://trilug.org/~porter/ipv6/">(Slides)</a>
Adding IPv6 support to a web provisioning interface for a large telecom project. 

<strong>Jym Williams-Zavada:</strong> <a href="http://www.jrwz.net/technical/mikrotik-ipv6/">(Slides)</a>
Getting a mikrotik router to work with a Hurricane Electric IPv6 tunnel, enabling IPv6 on my LAN.  And if there's time, also about the IPv6 firewall rules I use to protect my LAN nodes from the rest of the IPv6 Internet.

You've heard the buzz and seen the slides, now come get hands-on experience with IPv6 on your own equipment. Bring your PCs, smartphones, tablets, routers, or other interesting devices to see how they'll work in our IPv6 test lab.
