Jim Salter - This talk will start with an intro to KVM then will move to a focus on mixed-source environments, aka using Linux to take some of the pain and agony out of managing Windows servers that we just can't get away from. I am very passionate about KVM, especially in regards to mixed-source environments.  My day-to-day business largely involves system administration in businesses that are open to OSS, but still can't get away from applications that require a Windows environment - so taking a lot of the sting out by virtualizing Windows Server under Linux is near and dear to me, and is a pretty exciting field in my opinion. =) I have administered and managed and designed the infrastructure for a couple of Alexa Top 1000 sites, generating upwards of 60GB of Apache logfiles per day for a single site using off-the-shelf open source apps, filesystems, and kernels.

Special Guest
For the October 11th meeting, we also will have a special guest! The founder of POSSCON, Todd Lewis, will be speaking to the group briefly before the presentation begins. The Palmetto Open Source Software Conference has brought world-class speakers and content to the Southeast to discuss the latest open and open source issues for technologists, business and government IT leaders, and educators. See for yourself at http://www.posscon.org

Jim Salter - Bio
Jim is a voracious open source advocate, technologist and author. He first chose open source in 1999 when he ran Apache on FreeBSD, set up his first FreeBSD server from scratch in 2001 and first installed an open source product professionally, FreeBSD 4.5 and Samba over an old Windows NT 3.5 Server, in 2002. In 2004 he founded FreeBSDwiki.net, subtitled "FreeBSD For The Impatient", as an open documentation project available to the public. It now has over 500 articles, over 30,000 edits, and 10,000+ unique visitors per month with 65% of content being self-authored. For many years it was one of the top 1,000 top/busiest wikis on the planet as measured by number of edits. Since 2003 he has operated his own system administration and application development company implementing hundreds of open source solutions for a wide variety of clients.

Todd Lewis - Bio
Todd started the Open IT Lab in January 2011 to promote open source awareness, education and application. He also founded and serves as Chair of POSSCON, one of the largest open source conferences in the Southeast, and serves as managing partner of Palmetto Computer Labs, an open source consulting firm. His focus on open source started after reading David Wheeler's "Why Open Source Software/Free Software (OSS/FS, FLOSS, or FOSS)? Look at the Numbers!". He continues because of the numerous opportunities open source creates for anyone interested.


TriLUG Kids
Children are welcome to bring their parents to TriLUG with them! While we can't provide any official childcare, coöperation between parents is encouraged so that all people who would like to attend can do so without worrying about the little ones. The current primary contact is Cristóbal Palmer, who is best reached by email at cmp@cmpalmer.org with "TriLUG Childcare" as the subject line.
