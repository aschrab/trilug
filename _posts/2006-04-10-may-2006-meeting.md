The May TriLUG meeting will be held Thursday, May 11, 2006 at Red Hat Headquarters (<a href="http://www.redhat.com/about/contact/ww/americas/raleigh.html">map and directions</a>) at 7pm.

Tanner Lovelace, et. al. will be discussing Certificate security using the CACert.Org Certificate Authority.  We're planning on having enough CACert assurers at the meeting to give you 100 or more points at a single event.  Stay tuned for details.

May is also the month for our annual Steering Committee elections.  Nominations for any of the five positions should be sent to the trilug list or to steering AT trilug DOT org by 4 May, 2006 at 23:59:59.  Note that 5 members are elected to the Committee "at-large" and the positions are determined by a game of "Not-it" shortly thereafter.
