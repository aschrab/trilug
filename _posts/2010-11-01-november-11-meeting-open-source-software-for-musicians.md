Have you ever wanted to use your computer to record or play music?

In the old days, it took a studio full of equipment to produce and record music.  But now, the required tools are much more affordable, and can easily fit into a home studio.  There is a wide selection of very robust audio applications that run on standard PC hardware, and many of them are FREE ("free" as in "beer" -- but also as in "freedom").

Adam Drew has been playing and recording music on and with computers for 15 years. He was introduced to free and open source software when he went to work at Red Hat, where he does filesystem and cluster support.

Adam will show how anyone can use Linux-based software to produce studio-quality music.  We'll look at what tools are available, how they work together, and we'll see and hear them in action. We'll also learn a bit about what community resources are available for learning more about the tools and technology so that you can get plugged in and start making music at home and get your questions answered when they come up.

Come join us for a lively toe-tapping demonstration!

Adam invites you to take a look at (and edit) his audio knowledgebase at http://LinkedListCorruption.com/audio-kbase .  And if you need to reach him personally, send him an email at adam@LinkedListCorruption.com .

We would also like to thank our meeting sponsor, Uzoma Nwosu from the Signal Foundation (www.signalfest.com).
