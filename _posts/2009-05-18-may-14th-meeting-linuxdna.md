Tyler McAdams has been researching ways to fine-tune systems to run extremely fast.  He is involved with a global project called "LinuxDNA", which aims to optimize the binaries which run on a machine, with special emphasis on the kernel.  His team employs a compiler from Intel that is very good at producing optimized code for the x86 family of processors.

Bonus points if you can tell which distro Tyler likes to run (see below).

Come hear Tyler tell his secrets and his war stories about making Linux run FAST.
