<strong>OPEN SOURCE SHOWCASE</strong>
Like last year, LUG members will be showcasing open source stuff (hardware, software or data) that they find interesting.

Sign up for a show-n-tell, or sign up to bring some food, snacks, goodies or beverages (adult or otherwise).  You can also list ideas that you would like someone else to present.

The sign-up sheet is on the wiki: <a href="http://trilug.org/wiki/Meeting:2012_December_13">http://trilug.org/wiki/Meeting:2012_December_13</a>

<strong>NOTE</strong> - The wiki contains the world's cheesiest spam protection.  When you get the HTTP Authentication pop-up enter <strong>TRI</strong> in the username field and <strong>LUG</strong> in the password field.
To edit the page, you'll need to log in to this wiki... this is not your shell account password.  There's a link on the left to log in or create a new account.

In previous years, we've seen a wide variety of stuff in the showcase: music tools, 3D-printing, Arduino projects, BackupPC, a local distro mirror, pfSense, Rockbox, Bluetooth tools, ShairPort, networking tools.

Take a chance to geek out with the LUG, see what others are up to, and mingle a little, jingle a little.
