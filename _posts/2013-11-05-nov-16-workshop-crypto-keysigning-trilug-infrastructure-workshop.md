<strong>Crypto Key Signing</strong>
Learn about cryptographic keys and how to sign and verify GPG keys. Some people also want to do <a href="http://www.cacert.org/">CA Cert Assurances</a>. Don't forget to bring multiple forms of ID and you may also want to generate your key prior to the meeting.

<strong>TriLUG Infrastructure</strong>
The TriLUG servers provide all sorts of services to our members. This workshop will continue our effort to update and improve these services. This is open to anyone who would like to learn and participate in maintaining our shared resources.

<strong>RSVP & Building Access</strong>
Everyone should meet in the lobby promptly at 10am, and we'll go upstairs together. Latecomers should check in at the security desk and will be escorted from there.

Important: Red Hat security needs a list of attendees 24 hours in advance. Please RSVP. There may be some wriggle room here, but this is the first time we have tried this venue.
