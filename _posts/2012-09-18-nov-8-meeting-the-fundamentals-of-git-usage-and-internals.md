<strong>GIT :</strong>
Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. Git was initially designed and developed by Linus Torvalds for Linux kernel development; it has since been adopted by many other projects. Website: <a href="http://git-scm.com/">git-scm.com</a>

<strong>Synopsis:</strong>
Git is a powerful tool that suffers from an abstruse and leaky user interface and a somewhat steep learning curve. Using git effectively requires a working knowledge of how it functions. In this talk you will learn the very basics of using git along with what is happening under the hood while you use it.

<strong>Bio:</strong>
Jimmy has been programming since he was 7 or so and is currently a freelance Rails and iOS developer. He has been using git since 2006 and depends very heavily on it for everything from production and side-project code to configuration. When not programming, he spends time with his family, attending church, helping to run a small classical Christian school in Mebane (Mebbin, not Meebane), and collecting hobbies. His superpower is spewing out useless trivia at tangents to the current conversation. Did you know that North Carolina has more varieties of fungus than any of the other
lower 48 states?
