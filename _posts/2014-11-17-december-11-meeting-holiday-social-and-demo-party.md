You are invited to the Triangle Linux Users Group's annual Holiday Social & Demo Party ! Come and socialize with other like minded Free and Open Source enthusiasts from all over the Raleigh Durham Chapel Hill area.

The party will be held in Red Hat's 8th Floor Training Room. People should gather in the Red Hat Lobby on the ground floor where they will be escorted up to the 8th floor. Free Parking is available in the Red Hat Building as long as you enter after 7pm. This parking lot has designated Accessible Parking spaces and elevators down to the main lobby. On street parking is free after 6pm.

Please RSVP using the above form so we can pre-authorize building security. This will also enable us to budget food and space. Food will be catered from <a href="http://www.neomonde.com/home/">Neomonde</a>, as well as side dishes and treats contributed by our members.

We do not have permission to have alcohol at the Red Hat building, so please don't bring any.

<strong>Demos</strong>
Share your passion by bringing a project or product to show off. As we get more demos we'll try to keep the list up to date! If you want some inspiration, have a look at the demos from previous years: <a href="/2013-12-12/demo">2013</a>, <a href="/2012-12-13/party">2012</a>.

<strong>Chit Channel</strong> - Wes Garrison
"Thermal printer that works over the 3G wireless network that allows sending ""chits"" for fulfillment, sending confirmation of receipt to a server via 3G, and notification of completion to a server. We're using it to send food order tickets to our restaurants, get confirmation that they received the order, and get notification when the food is ready without human intervention. I'd like to know if anyone has other ideas for its application outside of food  (ie. this would be perfect for ordering unobtanium candle holders!)"
