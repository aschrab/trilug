Work on a personal project, hone your skills, or try something you learned about at a recent meeting. While you're at it, help us maintain the TriLUG infrastructure.

This month we'll be mostly playing with personal projects while we look forward to our new server coming online.  Come on down and hack on something fun, or play around with Docker, maybe containerize a favorite application.
