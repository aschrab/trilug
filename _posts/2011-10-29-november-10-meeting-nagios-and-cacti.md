No network is complete without an effective monitoring solution, and who doesn't love a good graph or two?

Come to TriLUG's November meeting to learn the ins and outs of network and service monitoring.  Fellow TriLUG member Dylan Lusk will introduce Nagios and Cacti, two premier projects in the world of FOSS monitoring tools.  

Dylan will go into the details of setting up a host system to monitor the health of your network.  He will then show how to setup and integrate devices and services into the monitoring.
