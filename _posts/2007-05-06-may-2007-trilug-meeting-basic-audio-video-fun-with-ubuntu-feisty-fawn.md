The next meeting of the Triangle Linux Users Group will be held at 7:00PM at Red Hat HQ (<a href="http://www.redhat.com/about/contact/ww/americas/raleigh.html">directions</a>) on May 10, 2007.  

Our speaker will be Tom Billman of Giant Shoulder, Inc.  The talk focuses on some basic video (DV and MPEG-2) processing using open source software on Linux with Ubuntu Feisty Fawn.  Simple DV editing will be performed using Kino.  Simple MPEG-2 (and maybe some AVI) editing will be performed using avidemux. A couple audio tools will be shown, SoundJuicer, FLAC to ogg transcoding, Rhythmbox. The awkwardtv AppleTV hacking scene will be covered for a couple minutes.  VLC and Mplayer will be used to display video and audio.   Streaming video will be demonstrated.

This meeting is sponsored by Integrated Technical Services (www.itsco.com).  

As always, this meeting is free and open to all interested parties.  Beverages and pizza are provided at no cost, but donations are always accepted.
