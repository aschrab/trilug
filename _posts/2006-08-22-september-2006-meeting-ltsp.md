The September Triangle Linux Users Group meeting will be held on September 14 at RedHat HQ <a href="http://www.redhat.com/about/contact/ww/americas/raleigh.html">map and directions</a>

In a traditional office setting, there are relatively high powered Intel based PC's spread around at every desk. Each with several gigabytes of hard disk space. Users store their own data on the local hard drives and backups are rarely (if ever) performed.

Does it really make sense to have a full computer at each desk?

The Linux Terminal Server Project (LTSP) <a href="http://www.ltsp.org/">http://www.ltsp.org/</a> provides asimple way to utilize low cost workstations as either graphical or character based terminals on a GNU/Linux server.

Jason Tower will present and demonstrate LTSP, and how to put those old low-powered machines to use.
