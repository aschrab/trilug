Zero configuration networking allows machines on a network to publish their capabilities for others to use, without requiring an administrator to specifically list those services in a directory.

TriLUG member Jym Williams-Zavada will be taking a look at two zeroconf services, AirPrint and mDNS.  Both of these technologies were introduced by Apple, and now they are gaining support on other platforms as well.

AirPrint allows you to publish the presence of a printer, and then allow devices to print to it.  The quintessential use case is printing from an iPhone or iPad.

Similarly, mDNS publishes the presence of other services on a network.  Perhaps you have a public shared drive where you store your music.

Jym will show us how to configure both of these services on a Linux machine.

Jym Williams-Zavada has been a member of TriLUG since he moved to NC from Syracuse, where he was active in SyrLUG.  He served on the TriLUG steering committee last year.  Jym currently works as a system administrator at Shodor in Durham.
