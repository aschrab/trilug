Have you ever wanted to run a bare-bones Linux system?  One that is smaller than your normal desktop or server distro?  Does DSL (Damn Small Linux) seem bloated and bulky to you?

Have you ever wanted to cook your food over an SSL connection?  Do any of your kitchen appliances have a penguin sticker on them?

This month, our very own Alan Porter will share his experience at "the oven place" (www.tmio.com), creating a Linux-based kitchen appliance for home use.  Weighing in at 256 MB of flash and 256 MB of RAM, this 550-pound appliance connects to the internet, refrigerates AND cooks food, and allows you to control it remotely.  Alan will show us what goes into the minimalist Linux distro that powers this nifty gadget.  Cooking demo included.
