<h1>Applications of Linux and Nanocomputers</h1>

The recent introduction of nanocomputers (book-sized x86 boxes) can combined with Linux in creative combinations opens the possibility for innovative, custom computing solutions.

James will describe how he used both to create a space-saving, low-power, custom server for his home network. those old low-powered machines to use.

The talk will include details on where he acquired x86 nanocomputer equipment and how he "rolled his own" custom Linux mini-distro.
