Due to the overwhelming success of the first Hack Day,  TriLUG is doing it again: Hack Day No.2.

Hack Days are kind of like an install fest, where members come together face to face to share ideas and lend a helping hand.  The theme for this hack day will be on running Linux (OpenWRT) on Wireless Routers.  We ran out of time at the last Hack Day, so let's do it again.

Please add your router to the table on the <a href="http://trilug.org/wiki/2012-03-10-hackday">OpenWRT Hack Day wiki</a>.
