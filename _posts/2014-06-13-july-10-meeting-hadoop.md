What is Hadoop? 
The Apache Hadoop software library is a framework that allows for the distributed processing of large data sets across clusters of computers using simple programming models. It is designed to scale up from single servers to thousands of machines, each offering local computation and storage. Rather than rely on hardware to deliver high-availability, the library itself is designed to detect and handle failures at the application layer, so delivering a highly-available service on top of a cluster of computers, each of which may be prone to failures. (<a href="http://hadoop.apache.org">http://hadoop.apache.org</a>)

This introduction to Hadoop will briefly cover its history and then dive deeply into where the Hadoop ecosystem is today using the Hortonworks Data Platform (HDP).  After the history session we'll talk about the main components, cluster operation, software development and tie the ecosystem components together.  Lastly, there will be a demonstration of the popular tools used for data manipulation and querying.   

If you wish to follow along with the demonstration download the HDP Sandbox VM here: <a href="http://hortonworks.com/products/hortonworks-sandbox/">http://hortonworks.com/products/hortonworks-sandbox/</a>
