After months of hard work and phone tag by TriLUG sysadmins and volunteers, our new server, Moya, has been racked and installed in temporary housing! (Thanks to MetaMetrics for providing the space!) Our mission tonight is to convert our current server into a VM and get it running on the new server.

We will plan and coordinate our efforts in advance on the #trilug-sys IRC channel, on irc.freenode.net.
