The September 2007 meeting of the Triangle Linux Users Group (Sponsored by <a href="http://www.zenoss.com/">Zenoss</a>) will be held at 7pm, September 13, at Red Hat on the Centennial Campus of North Carolina State University (<a href="http://www.redhat.com/about/contact/ww/americas/raleigh.html">directions</a>) .  The talk is on Linux video editing, given by Joey Carr.

The talk will introduce the capabilities of several of the most basic tools in linux video production (kino/dvgrab, cinelerra, ffmpeg, and mencoder).  Other tools and multimedia-focused linux distributions will be discussed.  A basic production workflow will be demonstrated for video capture via IEEE 1394 (i.e. Firewire), and editing in Kino.  Finally, options for DVD authoring will be covered in brief. 

Joey previously worked as a Java developer and later as a business analyst for a medical informatics application service provider.  He recently returned to UNC to study film and video production in the department of Communication Studies.  He is currently working for <a href="http://ibiblio.org">iBiblio</a> on their video speaker and other projects.
