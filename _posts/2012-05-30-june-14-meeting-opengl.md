This TriLUG meet is an introduction in OpenGL. OpenGL (Open Graphics
Library) is a hardware independent, cross-platform, cross-language API
for developing graphical interfaces. It takes simple points, lines and
polygons and gives the programmer the liberty to create outstanding
projects.

This presentation will cover the following:
 - Introducing GLUT
 - Creating a 2D Square
 - Manipulating the Square
 - OpenGL Rotation &Transform
 - Adding 3D Rotation to the 2D Square
 - Generating a pseudo-complex objects with a simple for loop

Although OpenGL is cross-language, the presentation code will be
displayed in C but understanding C is not needed.
