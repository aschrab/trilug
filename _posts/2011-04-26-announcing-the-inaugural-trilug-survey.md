Exciting times are at hand!

As one might guess from the subject of this announcement, the TriLUG Steering Committee is unleashing its first experiment in the realm of data and demographics.  We have carefully crafted our inaugural online survey, one which we hope will reveal who our constituents are and how they feel about TriLUG.

Since we believe in open source and value your privacy, and thanks to the excellent <a href="http://limesurvey.org">LimeSurvey project</a>, our survey is entirely hosted on TriLUG hardware.  Your responses are anonymous and will not be shared with third parties.  That said, please refrain from abusing your anonymity to the detriment of our efforts.

This is not an excessively long survey.  However, you may want to set aside 15-20 minutes just to be safe.  If you get interrupted, there is a button to save and resume later at the bottom of each question.

Though it should go without saying, survey participation is entirely voluntary.  We don't know who you are, so no one will hold it against you if you roll your eyes and delete this message.  But if you are willing to help TriLUG become the best LUG ever, follow the link below to begin...

This survey will be active for approximately 30 days, so don't miss your chance to be heard.  Shortly after it closes, we hope to publish a summary of the responses for all to see.

Any questions or concerns should be sent to the <a href="http://trilug.org/contact">Steering Committee</a>.  Thank you in advance for your participation!
