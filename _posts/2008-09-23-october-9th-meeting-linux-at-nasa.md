Robert Singleterry, a researcher from NASA Langley Research Center will be speaking on his discovery of open source software in his quest to study space radiation.

Robert will discuss the trials and tribulations of a Student / GPC / EI International / Grad Student / ANL-W / NASA engineer, and his trip from sole source software to the open source world.  There were mountains to climb, holes to watch out for, and eventually smooth sailing ahead for this engineer's usage of open source software at NASA, all while doing his real job of space radiation research.

Robert will share his experiences of sole source and open source software, and how the two interact with each other.  And he will describe the environments in which he made the open source transition, which range from a single work laptop to high performance computing clusters.
