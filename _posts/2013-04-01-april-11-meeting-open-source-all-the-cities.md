What are the elements of an open source city? Learn how open source is influencing the open government movement in Raleigh. Weâ€™ll take a brief look at policy, participation, culture, and apps in Raleigh. You might be surprised how much is happening in the Triangle region, even if you're not a civic geek. I'll also talk about my book, The Foundation of an Open Source, and my successful crowdfunding campaign. This will very much be both a presentation and a conversation.
