Now is your chance to install that favorite Linux or UNIX distro you always wanted on your computer.  At Installfest we will have workshops to help you install Linux right, and tune it properly for your intended purpose, including advice from professional sys-admins and long-time experienced Linux and UNIX users.

We will be meeting at Splat*Space in Durham, from 10:00am to 5:00pm.  Go here for directions to Splat*Space: <a href="http://splatspace.org/location/">http://splatspace.org/location/</a>

No prior experience is required to attend TriLUG Installfest and you don't need to own the latest hardware. There are plenty of members who will be glad to work with you and allow you ask questions.  You don't need to be a member of TriLUG or Splat*Space in order to attend, but please do ask about the membership options while you're there.  It's a great group of folks and there's a good chance that you'll share interests with many of the other members.

The hardest questions about Linux will be answered:

* What distro?
* What disk partitioning should I use?
* What desktop interface should I use?
* What do I do about file management & backups?
* What about servers and daemons?

Bring your own computer or computers or other devices and join us to install that perfect system you've always wanted.  We will have the latest popular distros available, or you can bring your own iso's.

Besides the usual categories of installations such as general, game playing, entertainment, development workstation, home or small business server, this year we will also be installing netbook, pad and small devices and single-board computers and embedded systems and microcontrollers.

Yes we will also be installing UNIX and Android systems.

Some effort will be made to mentor some application installations, like office apps, development IDE's, web servers and so on.

Join us for fun, frolic, and Linux.
