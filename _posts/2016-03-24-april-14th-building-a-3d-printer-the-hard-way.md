Abstract:

 Desktop 3D printing has become fairly popular in the last few years,
 and affordable printers are flooding the market. But why buy a
 difficult to hack black box when you could spend weeks
 sourcing/printing parts, crimping a a bunch of wires, and calibrating a
 fully open design from the RepRap project?

 Aside from the freedom that comes from building your own libre hardware
 printer, building your own has many advantages that make the effort
 worth it. Want dual extrusion? Triple, quadruple extrusion even? Or how
 about pushing the limits by printing clay or icing? Perhaps you'd like
 a tiny but super fast printer, one you could fold up and fit into a
 backpack, or a printer with a meter of build height. With a libre
 hardware printer, you can do all of this -- and far more affordably
 than purchasing or modifying a closed printer platform.

 This talk will cover the advantages (and disadvantages) of building a
 libre hardware printer with a focus on the popular RepRap Prusa i3
 family. Finding the community, selecting one of dozens of designs,
 sourcing components, and building a printer from scratch can be a
 harrowing experience -- this talk should provide some orientation in
 the chaos and make the process easier.

 The talk will also cover using a 3D printer with 100% Free Software on
 GNU/Linux, from designing models (including the printer itself!) to the
 microcontroller running the printer.
 

Bio:

 Clinton Ebadi is a kilt-wearing, cat-loving, Free Software
 enthusiast. He's spent most of the last decade volunteering for the
 Internet Hosting Cooperative and learning way more than anyone should
 know about OpenAFS. After picking up an Arduino last year to make a few
 LED strips blink, he found himself borrowing a friend's 3D printer a
 few months later, and ended up hooked on hardware hacking.
