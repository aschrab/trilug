Topic: Open Source Showcase and Holiday Social
Presenter: You!
When: Thursday, December 8, 7pm
Where: SplatSpace, 331 W. Main St., Durham, NC

Back by popular demand, our holiday meeting will be at SplatSpace (our local hackerspace) in Durham, NC.

We will provide space to anyone who wants to showcase open source projects they find interesting. It can be software, hardware, or data -- just as long as it's free (as in speech). Think of it as a science fair or show-and-tell for open source enthusiasts.

We will also open up the kitchen area for anyone who wants to bring snacks, desserts, and drinks to share with everyone else. These items do not have to be open source, but you definitely get extra geek cred if there is a creative-commons licensed recipe sitting next to the food you bring. It also makes it easier for folks like me, who try and avoid gluten, to know what's safe to eat.

The doors open at 7pm and you can wander from table to table, to see the neat things people are showcasing. If you are presenting something, be sure to let us know which things you want to see. We will try to coordinate breaks for people so that even the presenters get a chance to see the things that interest them.

If you'd like to showcase something or bring some food to share, please add an entry to the wiki page: <a href="http://trilug.org/wiki/Meeting:2011_December_8">http://trilug.org/wiki/Meeting:2011_December_8</a>

PLEASE NOTE: To make things a little harder for spammers, you have to enter a username and password to access the wiki. The username is "TRI" and the password is "LUG".

You may also add things to the wiki page that you simply wish someone would demonstrate. That said, please consider running that table yourself. It's completely OK to show up with 20 copies of a live CD that you've been meaning to try out and to invite others to sit down and tinker on it with you. The important parts of this meeting are sharing your interests with others and socializing. Please let us know ASAP that you intend to present something, so that we can reserve a table and chair for you.

Alan Porter, one of our fantastic steering committee members, has volunteered to demo an Arduino system, "that measures and records environmental stats for our hermit crab's cage.  It's like a Star Trek tricorder for crustaceans.  The hardware and development tools are all open source - so share and enjoy!"

I've heard rumors that someone is bringing egg nog, but I'm not sure how much. What are you bringing? Go add it to the wiki now :)

Looking forward to seeing all of you at SplatSpace on December 8!

Kind regards,
Justis Peters
