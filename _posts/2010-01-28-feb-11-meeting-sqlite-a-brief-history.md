Database technology has a long and rich history.  Come listen to Richard mesmerize us with tales of the database world of yore, and the original reasons behind SQLite.

Richard will further <!--break--> delve into the evolution and world-wide adoption of SQLite up to the present day, survey the current state of database technology (and the trending "NoSQL" idea in particular), and how it all relates to embedded databases like SQLite.  Finally, he'll tie it up with prognostications on future turns of database technology.
