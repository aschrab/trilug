In January, we will welcome Justin Parker into the LUG in the harshest way we know how... by inviting him to be a speaker.

Justin recently moved to the Triangle.  His previous job was with VMware, one of the pioneers of virtualization.  He will give us an overview of virtualization, and the features of the various VMware products.  And he will guide us through setting up a virtual server.  All of this, he says, without trying to sound too much like a "fanboy".
