excerpt: !ruby/string:Sequel::SQL::Blob "The December Podcast, audio from Daniel Chen's
  June talk on Ubuntu Dapper Drake, is now available via the feed <a href=http://www.trilug.org/podcastogg>http://www.trilug.org/podcastogg</a>.
  \ \r\n\r\nIn the interest of simplifying the production of the TriLUG Podcast, the
  m4a format podcast is no longer available.  However, the podcast is now available
  in the equally patent-encumbered format mp3.  That feed is available at <a href=http://www.trilug.org/podcastmp3>http://www.trilug.org/podcastmp3</a>.
  \ The m4a feed will continue to be updated until the mp3 feed shows up in iTMS.
  \ Given some technical limitations of converting and encoding the podcast, patent-encumbered
  versions maybe a short-lived phenomenon.  I'm looking for feedback on this.  \r"

A few additional notes about the podcast...

This is the first podcast featuring our new intro and "outro" featuring the voices of past meetings, specifically Paul Unbehagen (Web 2.0), Daniel Chen (Ubuntu), Tanner Lovelace (CA Cert), and Jason Faulkner (Nagios).  

The program is produced with open source software, particularly Audacity.  

The intro and outro music is "Good Thoughts" by the Sim Redmond Band.  Used with permission.
