This month's topic is Zenoss Core.  Zenoss Core is an open-source network management platform which monitors your applications, servers, and network infrastructure using SNMP, syslog, polling - even custom scripts and Nagios plugins! The bells-and-whistles you get with this open-source platform, like its Ajax-based user interface and integration with Google Maps, will truly dazzle you.

Come to the January meeting and see why this impressive, GPL-licensed management platform is among the top five Sourceforge downloads. Mark Turner of Zenoss will be presenting.

Also - starting this month, we'll be raffling off tech books, gadgets, etc, so show up and get your ticket.
