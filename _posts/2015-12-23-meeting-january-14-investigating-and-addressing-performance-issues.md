<strong>Synopsis</strong><br>
Rather than just accepting poor system performance, you can use the tools available in Linux to better understand the underlying causes of those issues and suggest ways of resolving them. This presentation will include:

- How to use tools such as the Linux kernel's perf tool to show what regions of code consume the most processor time.
- How to identify areas of an application that most need to be optimized.
- How modern processors work (just enough to better interpret performance data).
- A demonstration of these tools running on a <a href="http://www.96boards.org/products/ce/dragonboard410c/">Dragonboard 410c</a>, an inexpensive aarch64 development board.

<strong>Bio</strong><br>
William Cohen has been a developer of performance tools at Red Hat for the past decade. He has worked on numerous performance tools in Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Fedora, including OProfile, PAPI, SystemTap, and Dyninst.

<strong>Officer Nominations</strong><br>
