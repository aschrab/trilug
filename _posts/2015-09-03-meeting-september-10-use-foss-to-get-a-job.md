Tonight's meeting is sponsored by <a href="http://allthingsopen.org/">All Things Open</a>, a conference exploring open source, open tech, and the open Web in the enterprise. All Things Open will be held October 19th & 20th in the Raleigh Convention Center.

<strong>Synopsis</strong>
Using free and open source software, and participating in the associated communities, <em>can</em> make you more employable! This presentation will cover how to get started as a community participant and how to gain résumé-enhancing experience. Special guests representing a variety of local organizations will then join us for an interactive discussion about hiring trends, which FOSS skills make a candidate stand out, and any questions <em>you</em> may have for someone directly responsible for hiring FOSS-experienced engineers.
