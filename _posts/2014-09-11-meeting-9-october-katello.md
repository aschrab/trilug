<strong>Synopsis:</strong>
What is Katello and how can it help me?

Katello (<a href="http://katello.org/">http://katello.org/</a>) is a systems lifecycle management plugin to Foreman (<a href="http://theforeman.org/">http://theforeman.org/</a>), and the next-generation replacement for the very-popular Spacewalk (<a href="http://spacewalk.redhat.com/">http://spacewalk.redhat.com/</a>). Katello adds software and subscription management capabilities to Foreman, which itself offers configuration management and provisioning via Puppet.

Katello might be useful to you if:
- you are a novice to advanced system administrator
- you are managing 10 to 10,000+ hosts
- you want to control the content available to hosts based on rules you define
- you want to provision hosts using the content you are managing
- you want hosts to consume content that you are managing
- you would like to interact with the system using a web UI, CLI or REST API

This presentation will cover topics such as managing the lifecycle of content, provisioning systems with that content and enabling existing systems to consume content.
