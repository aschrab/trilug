After months of hard work and phone tag by TriLUG sysadmins and volunteers, our new server, Moya, has been racked and installed in temporary housing! (Thanks to MetaMetrics for providing the space!) Our mission tonight is to set up basic virtualization infrastructure to run the next generation of TriLUG services, and to stand up a replica of our current server, Pilot, to assist in porting services over.

We will plan and coordinate our efforts in advance on the #trilug-sys IRC channel, on <a href="https://www.freenode.net/">irc.freenode.net</a>.
