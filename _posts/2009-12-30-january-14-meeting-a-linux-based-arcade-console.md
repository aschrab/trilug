Thomas has been working on something that is part art, part tech, and part FUN.  He has an arcade game console with Linux under the hood.

Come hear Thomas tell us how he selected appropriate PC hardware, external controller boards and game inputs.  He'll share his experiences putting it all together, from wood-working to soldering to software configuration.  He'll show us some working parts (and some not-so-working parts), and photos of the almost complete game machine -- sorry, it's way too heavy to bring to the meeting!
