Business Intelligence has become one of the business world's most valuable tools to determine upcoming business decisions.  Thanks to the open source revolution, BI is no longer just for enterprise level businesses.
<!--break-->
This presentation will go over the different areas of Business Intelligence and show just how far open source alternatives have come in each area.  BI can be broken down into five distinct areas, which include:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Reporting
<li> Data Warehousing
<li> Statistical Analysis
<li> Visualization
<li> Predictive Analytics
</ul>
From the very basic reporting to the most advanced predictive analytics, open source can cover many of the features and capabilities of their multi-million dollar competitors.
