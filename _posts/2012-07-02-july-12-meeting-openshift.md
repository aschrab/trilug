Wesley Hearn will be presenting <a href="https://openshift.redhat.com/app/">OpenShift</a>, a cloud computing platform as a service product from Red Hat.

<!--break-->

This meeting is sponsored by Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina, the stateâ€™s largest health insurance company, providing service to over 3.5 million North Carolinians.  BCBSNC will have a representative at the meeting to discuss insurance plans that they offer, specifically for the self-employed.

<strong>Synopsis:</strong>
Wesley Hearn will be going over what Cloud computing is and where OpenShift is inside the Cloud stack. After everyone has a grasp on Cloud computing, he will go over how OpenShift differs from OpenShift Origin. Then it is on to the semi-fun stuff, the different components of OpenShift Origin and how they work together. Once Wesley has gone over all of this, he will show you how to set up and deploy a local install(he will be doing it in KVM) so you can develop and test your application before you push it to OpenShift.
