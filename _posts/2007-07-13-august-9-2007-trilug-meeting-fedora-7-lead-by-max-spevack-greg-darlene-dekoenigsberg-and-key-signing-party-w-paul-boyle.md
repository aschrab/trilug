The August 2007 meeting of the Triangle Linux Users Group (Sponsored by <a href="http://redhat.com/">Red Hat, Inc.</a>) will be held at 7pm, August 9, at Red Hat on the Centennial Campus of North Carolina State University (<a href="http://www.redhat.com/about/contact/ww/americas/raleigh.html">directions</a>) .  Our speakers will be Max Spevack and Greg DeKoenigsberg of the Fedora Project and Red Hat, Inc.  

There will be a special announcement for TriLUG members at the beginning of this meeting.  

The talk is on Fedora 7 from the perspective of a free software contributor:

1) How packages get into Fedora.  Who owns them, how they are built, etc.

2) The compose tools that actually create the distribution.  How they work, how to contribute to them, and how to use them in order to spin a custom version of Fedora.  A demonstration will be in order!

3) Fedora's community perspective.  How we try to build community -- both technical and non-technical -- and how people can become involved in Fedora.

Max Spevack is the current Fedora Project Leader.  He has been with Red Hat since 2004, previously as the QA team lead for Red Hat Network.  He has a BS in Computer Science. 

Greg DeKoenigsberg is the community development manager for Red Hat. He is a former leader and board member emeritus of the Fedora Project.  He has been with Red Hat since 2001.  Many of the members of TriLUG know him better as "Darlene".

There will also be a key signing arranged by Paul D. Boyle.
