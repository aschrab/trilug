It's that time of year again.  We have regenerated our SSL certificates for our web and mail servers.  Most people will notice this when their email client tries to connect to "mail.trilug.org" (which is the server name that you should use).  It will warn that the certificate has changed.  The new mail certificate fingerprints are:

SHA1 = 92:8A:60:97:6C:A9:37:C7:67:E4:A7:65:92:2E:06:65:64:CD:A0:5F
MD5 = DF:00:29:BB:0D:99:6F:BA:58:06:0A:86:9E:DD:9D:CB

Accept no imitations.
