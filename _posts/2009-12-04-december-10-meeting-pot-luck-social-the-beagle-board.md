Food: NO PIZZA THIS TIME - bring a dish to share

--

For the last few years in December, TriLUG has hosted a "social", a time to gather and eat and chat and play games, without the distractions of a planned presentation.

We're going to try something new this year, the hybrid talk / social meeting.

<!--break-->

Brian Phelps has been working with a pretty neat ARM-based embedded board called the "Beagle Board".  It's a very capable little machine, with very modest needs.  It has some smokin' hot graphics and lots of pins for hooking stuff up to it.  And it can be powered by a USB plug.

Before, during, and after Brian's presentation/demo, we will be sharing food with our peers.  Bring a dish, either something home-made or something store-bought, and share it with the group.
