Participation on these mailing lists is not the same as membership in the LUG. Meetings are the best way to get to know your fellow TriLUG members or to become a member. TriLUG meetings are held on the second Thursday of every month.  Attendance is free and open to the public.

Please note that it is TriLUG policy that the mailing lists archives be publicly accessible. All posts are plain text only and limited to 20kB in size. All html, attachments, etc are automatically stripped.

We are currently experiencing problems with Yahoo/AOL/Hotmail/AT&amp;T email adddresses due to a <a href="https://help.yahoo.com/kb/SLN7253.html">Yahoo's new anti-spam implementation</a>. (Bill Farrow 2014-10-06)

These are the main TriLUG mailing lists:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.trilug.org/mailman/listinfo/trilug-announce">TriLUG Announce</a> Mailing List. This is for Meeting Announcements and other important notices. This is not a discussion list and only the Steering Committee can post to it. Very low volume of emails.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.trilug.org/mailman/listinfo/trilug">TriLUG General</a> Mailing List.  General discussion on Linux and other topics. Email volume and subject matter range widely. </li>
<li><a href="http://www.trilug.org/mailman/listinfo/linux-ham">Linux-ham</a> Mailing List for the discussion of using Linux with Amateur Radio.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.trilug.org/mailman/listinfo/trilug-steering">TriLUG Steering Committee</a> Mailing List. This is a closed list for the steering committee members to coordinate meetings and the day-to-day operation of the LUG.
</ul>
