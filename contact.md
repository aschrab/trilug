<b>Recruiters please note:</b>  If you are here to request a mailing list posting about a job:
<ul>
<li>The best way to present jobs is to come to our meeting and participate in our "Have-a-Job/Need-a-Job" segment.  This segment allows any person with an opening or any person seeking a job to stand up in front of the entire group and talk for a few minutes.  See the <a hrf="http://www.trilug.org">trilug.org</a> for info about the next meeting.</li>
<li>If you can not attend a meeting, the next-best way is to join the <a href=http://www.trilug.org/mailman/listinfo/trilug>main discussion mailing list</a> and post your job to the list.  Please put the word "JOB" in the subject.  <b>Note:</b> we monitor posts to the list.  Recruiters who post irrelevant job postings or who "spam" the list with a lot of posts will be "moderated" or removed from the mailing list.</li>
</ul>

If you have something that you would like to bring to the attention of the Steering Committee, fill in the form below.  <b>This is not the place to post job openings.</b>  This form sends an email directly to the five steering committee members.
